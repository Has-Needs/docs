# Business Model:
### An Emergent Blueprint for a Post-Capitalist Economy

*This document outlines the unique, non-extractive revenue model of the Has-Needs protocol.*

### The Core Principle: Non-Extractive Value Creation

The Has-Needs protocol is built on a foundational rejection of the surveillance capitalism model (based on data extraction) and the traditional platform model (based on rent-seeking intermediation). The protocol's business model is designed to be **prosocial by design**, meaning its financial success is directly and verifiably aligned with the creation of positive social outcomes.

### The Revenue Model: 5% of Verified Cost Savings

The protocol's revenue is derived from a single source: a **5% commission on the independently verified cost savings** generated for an institutional partner during a specific deployment.

**How it Works (The Disaster Relief Example):**

1.  **Establish a Baseline:** A county government has historical data showing that their average cost for delivering essential services (water, food, shelter) during a hurricane is **$100 million**.
2.  **Deploy Has-Needs:** During the next hurricane, the county uses the Has-Needs protocol to coordinate aid. The protocol's ability to aggregate Needs, enable efficient peer-to-peer logistics, and provide real-time data dramatically reduces waste, fraud, and overhead.
3.  **Verify the Savings:** After the event, an independent, third-party auditor verifies that the total cost of the response using Has-Needs was only **$60 million**.
4.  **Calculate the Fee:** The verified cost saving is **$40 million**. The Has-Needs protocol's fee is 5% of this amount, which is **$2 million**.

### A Blueprint for a Post-Capitalist Economy

This model is a blueprint for a new kind of economy because its incentives are fundamentally different:

- **It profits from efficiency, not extraction.** The protocol only makes money when it creates measurable, real-world improvements and cost savings.
- **It is not based on creating artificial scarcity.** Its goal is to create a more efficient and equitable distribution of existing resources.
- **It aligns profit with positive social outcomes.** The more effective the protocol is at helping people, the more sustainable it becomes.

This creates a virtuous cycle, making the Has-Needs protocol a scalable and ethically sound engine for an emergent, more equitable economic paradigm.
