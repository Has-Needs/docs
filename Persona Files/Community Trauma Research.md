##Definition
Community trauma refers to the shared experiences and emotional responses that occur within a group or community following an event or series of events that cause significant distress. This type of trauma is not just limited to personal experiences but can also affect the collective psyche of the community, causing severe shock and further potentiating the traumatic experience.

"It is crucial for communities recovering from trauma to foster self-sufficiency and establish support systems to ensure they are not solely reliant on external aid in the long run." This quote emphasizes the importance of local resilience building and community empowerment as key factors in post-traumatic recovery.
