#### Introduction

As an aid worker in a typical international corporate "Big Aid" agency, I've witnessed firsthand the challenges of determining needs, managing logistics, and meeting the demands of donors for metrics to prove efficacy. Budgets are tight, theft is a constant concern, and relations with local governments are often strained. However, the introduction of Has-Needs, or "Ni-Aini" as it's locally called, has revolutionized how we operate and interact with communities.

#### Initial Skepticism and Transition

When people first started using Ni-Aini, we weren't sure what to make of it. One of our local workers introduced the system to us by setting up our organization as a Community on the platform. We were encouraged to post our organizational needs and the resources and services we had access to. 

#### Immediate Benefits

**Real-Time Coordination:**
- **Self-Organizing Communities:** Almost immediately, we were notified that nearby communities had self-organized, providing us with a to-do list of actionable items.
- **Efficient Task Management:** This list allowed us to tackle tasks systematically, knowing exactly what was needed and where our resources could be most effective.

**Enhanced Communication:**
- **Transparent Updates:** The system notified the community whenever we acted on their messages, reducing the need for us to manually coordinate these updates.
- **Building Trust:** This transparency built trust with the community, as they could see that we were actively working on their needs.

**Improved Logistics:**
- **Resource Tracking:** My boss can now coordinate with other aid organizations using a live stream of data on who has what, where it is, and where it needs to go.
- **Reducing Theft:** By notifying the community when shipments are dispatched and expected to arrive, we can work from both ends to quickly catch thieves.

#### Realizations and Impact

**Community Engagement:**
- **Citizen Empowerment:** It became clear that allowing citizens to post their needs and receive what they ask for directly empowers them and builds a sense of ownership and trust.
- **Identifying Leaders:** The system naturally highlights community organizers and those who are most helpful, eliminating the need for us to canvas the entire region.

**Shift in Perspective:**
- **Direct Impact:** Seeing the direct impact of our work through the system is incredibly satisfying. As someone trained to distrust civilian inputs, it's a relief to know that we are doing exactly what the community wants and needs.
- **Collaborative Effort:** The realization that it's okay if we don't have all the answers or resources—someone else in the network might—has been revolutionary.

#### Operational Efficiency

**Metrics and Accountability:**
- **Live Metrics:** The platform provides us with real-time metrics, making it easier to report to donors and prove the efficacy of our efforts.
- **Reduced Stress:** This reduces the stress on our organization to manually gather data and produce reports, allowing us to focus more on delivering aid.

**Community-Centric Approach:**
- **Responsive Aid:** The system's ability to respond to real needs as they arise has made our work more effective and appreciated.
- **Sustainable Solutions:** By directly addressing the community's expressed needs, we contribute to more sustainable and impactful solutions.

#### Conclusion

Has-Needs, or Ni-Aini, has transformed how we operate as an aid organization. It has streamlined our logistics, improved our coordination with other agencies, and built trust with the communities we serve. Most importantly, it has shifted our perspective from a top-down approach to a collaborative, community-driven model. This platform not only makes our job easier but also ensures that we are truly meeting the needs of those we aim to help.
