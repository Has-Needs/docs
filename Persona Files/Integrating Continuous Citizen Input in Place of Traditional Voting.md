In the Has-Needs system, the steady stream of citizen Needs can serve as a continuous, real-time form of voting on community priorities and initiatives. This approach leverages transparency and active participation to shape governance and resource allocation, making traditional voting less necessary. Hereâ€™s how this can be structured:

Key Components and Interactions
Continuous Citizen Input:

Needs as Votes: Every Need posted by a citizen acts as a vote indicating the importance of specific issues.
Community Needs: Larger communal Needs, such as infrastructure projects, also impact decision-making.
Transparency and Accountability:

Public Ledger: All Needs and their fulfillment statuses are recorded on a transparent, public ledger.
Governance Metrics: Track and display responsiveness and effectiveness of governance bodies based on their ability to meet Needs.
Real-Time Decision-Making:

Data Visualization: Use visual tools to display ongoing Needs and their statuses.
Dynamic Prioritization: Automatically prioritize resources and actions based on the frequency and urgency of Needs.
