I woke to a terrible crash. The ground trembled as the floodwaters surged through our village, leaving devastation in their wake. Our homes were destroyed, and our phones were useless. Amid the chaos, a box landed by parachute, carrying a glimmer of hope.

### Connecting with the World

The box had instructions to place it high up, preferably on a pole. We did as instructed, and my phone connected immediately. It allowed me to make calls to my brothers and uncle across the valley, a lifeline in our darkest hour. Then, a message from the box prompted me to upload the Ni-Aini app – Has-Needs in our language – and use it to send messages about what we needed and what we could do to help.

### Reaching Out

Using Ni-Aini, I posted that I needed workers and shovels to clear the mud from my house. Our crops and stored food were ruined, so I asked for rice, beans, and dried meat. Although we had some clean water, our well was in bad shape, so I put that out there as well. I offered to work, mentioning that I had a tractor buried under mud that needed to be dug out first.

### Community Response

Ni-Aini quickly matched my needs with a charity organization that had been in our area for years. Trusting them, I shared my location. I also received requests from three neighbors who needed my tractor and were willing to dig it out and fill the tank with fuel. The system facilitated our connections, enabling us to support one another without hesitation.

### Learning About Ni-Aini

Over time, we learned more about the Ni-Aini system. It was incredibly secure, ensuring that nothing could escape without our permission. The system prevented any "middle men" from stealing our digital identities or data, allowing us to be compensated for sharing our details.

### Transparency and Accountability

Organizations and agencies we dealt with had viewable chains, leading some kids in the village to create a data visualization. It used colors to show how many requests each organization answered. The same transparency applied when our government started using the system. Our local minister now has a color-coded indicator by his name showing how often his staff resolves our issues. If requests go unanswered for too long, the color becomes stale.

### A New Era of Trust

Nobody depends on politician promises anymore. If they did something, it’s on their chain. This transparency built trust and accountability in ways we had never experienced before.

### Conclusion

Ni-Aini transformed our community in a time of crisis, making it easier to ask for help and to offer assistance. The app bridged the gaps between us, fostering a spirit of mutual aid and resilience that carried us through the aftermath and beyond. As we learned to trust the system, it empowered us to take control of our data and hold those in power accountable, creating a brighter future for all of us.
