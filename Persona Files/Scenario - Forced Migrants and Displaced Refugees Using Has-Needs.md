Forced migrants and displaced refugees often face significant challenges, including uncertainty, fear, and hostility from local populations in transit areas. Traditional identification methods lack safeguards and often result in multiple databases containing personal and biometric data, which may be shared across borders without the individual’s consent. Has-Needs can transform this experience, ensuring privacy, dignity, and mutual respect.

#### **Arrival in a New Town**

Migrants and refugees arrive at the edge of a town or at the train station. They see QR codes posted prominently at these locations. These QR codes are designed to link them to the town’s resources and essential services without the need for direct interaction, reducing potential hostility and ensuring their safety.

#### **Accessing Resources**

1. **Scanning the QR Code:**
   - Migrants use their smartphones to scan the QR code.
   - The QR code links them to a resource map created by the town.

2. **Resource Map:**
   - The resource map displays available relief agencies, shelters, food supplies, medical services, and contact information for essential services.
   - The map is user-friendly and does not require volunteers to be GIS specialists.

   **Example Resource Map:**
   ```plaintext
   Resource Map for Townsville:
   - Shelter: St. Mary’s Church (2 km north)
   - Food Supply: Community Center (1.5 km west)
   - Medical Services: Town Hospital (3 km east)
   - Contact Information: Local Aid Coordinator (555-1234)
   ```

3. **Inputting Skills and Abilities:**
   - Migrants can input their skills and abilities into the Has-Needs system.
   - This information is matched with the Needs expressed by the local community.

   **Example Skills Input:**
   ```plaintext
   Skills: {
     "name": "Amina",
     "profession": "Engineer",
     "languages": ["English", "French"],
     "skills": ["Water management", "Renewable energy"]
   }
   ```

4. **Viewing Community Needs:**
   - Migrants can view the Needs posted by the community, such as requests for skilled labor or volunteer opportunities.
   - This enables migrants to contribute positively to the community they are passing through.

   **Example Community Needs:**
   ```plaintext
   Community Needs in Townsville:
   - Need: Volunteer for food distribution
   - Need: Skilled carpenter for repairs at community center
   - Need: Translator for French-speaking residents
   ```

#### **Ensuring Privacy and Respectful Data Management**

1. **Personal Information Control:**
   - Migrants maintain full control and ownership of their personal information and biometric data.
   - Has-Needs ensures that data is only shared with the consent of the individual.

2. **Secure Identification:**
   - The system uses secure, encrypted methods to verify identity without exposing sensitive information.
   - Biometric data, if used, is managed with strict privacy controls.

   **Example Secure Identification:**
   ```plaintext
   Identification: {
     "biometric_data": "encrypted_fingerprint_data",
     "status": "verified",
     "access": "controlled by user"
   }
   ```

#### **Building Mutual Respect and Recognizing Value**

1. **Humanizing Migrants:**
   - By inputting their skills and viewing community Needs, migrants are seen for their abilities and contributions rather than just their status as refugees.
   - This interaction fosters mutual respect and breaks down stereotypes.

2. **Creating Positive Interactions:**
   - The system facilitates respectful, non-confrontational interactions by providing resources and contact information without the need for direct requests.
   - Migrants and community members can connect based on shared goals and Needs, fostering a sense of collaboration.

   **Example Interaction:**
   ```plaintext
   Interaction:
   - Migrant: Inputs skills in renewable energy.
   - Community Member: Requests help setting up a solar panel system.
   - Outcome: Successful collaboration and mutual respect.
   ```

#### **Scenario in Practice**

**Day 1: Arrival and Access**
- A group of refugees arrives in Townsville, scans the QR code at the train station.
- They access the resource map and find nearby shelters and food supplies.
- Amina, an engineer, inputs her skills into the system.

**Day 2: Mutual Aid and Integration**
- Amina receives a match with a local Need for a volunteer to help with water management.
- She connects with the local aid coordinator and begins contributing her expertise.
- The local community appreciates her help, fostering a positive interaction.

**Ongoing: Building Respect and Trust**
- The migrants use Has-Needs to find resources and contribute to the community as they transit through different areas.
- Local communities recognize the value of the migrants’ skills and abilities, leading to more respectful and supportive interactions.
