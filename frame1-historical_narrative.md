# Frame 1: Historical Narrative ("The Correction")

The modern internet was created in the 1990s. A major problem being addressed was gaining user traction. In exchange for 'free' services and rapid growth, the W3C allowed commercial interests to lead and without or knowledge, traded away the most valuable thing we have: ownership of our own identity and data. This 'original sin' created the world of surveillance capitalism, digital manipulation, and institutional decay we live in today.

Has-Needs is the 'Declaration of Independence' for the digital age. It is an architectural solution, designed to build a new digital society on the principle of absolute individual sovereignty. With privacy by default and local-first design, humanity can be well established for resiliency and an equal footing in the information age. We are not just building a new platform; we are fixing the internet's broken foundation.
