# Problem Statement: The Failure of Centralized Trust

*This document outlines the systemic failures that the Has-Needs protocol is designed to solve.*

---

### The Original Sin of the Digital Age

The modern internet was built on a foundational, corrupt bargain. In the mid-1990s, a decision was made to trade individual sovereignty for "free" services. This led to the rise of **Surveillance Capitalism**, an economic model based on the non-consensual harvesting of personal data. In this model, the user is not the customer; they are the product being sold. This has created a multi-trillion dollar market that is ethically bankrupt, fundamentally insecure, and has become a primary vector for social and political manipulation.

### The Collapse of Institutional Integrity

This digital decay is mirrored in the physical world. Our core institutions—in governance, finance, and media—are suffering from a crisis of legitimacy. They are centralized, opaque, and have been captured by political and financial interests that do not serve the average citizen. This has led to:

- **Erosion of the Rule of Law:** Where accountability is bypassed for the powerful.
- **Systemic Inefficiency:** As seen in the catastrophic failures of top-down disaster relief, where aid is paralyzed by bureaucracy while people suffer.
- **Dehumanization:** Where individuals are treated as "burdens," "case files," or "demographics" to be managed, rather than as sovereign beings with inherent value.

### The Principles of a Solution

To solve a problem this deep, a new architecture is required. The Has-Needs protocol is built on a set of core tenets designed to directly counter these failures:

- **Sovereign Identity:** Every user owns and controls their own data and identity.
- **Dignity and Agency:** The system must empower individuals, especially in vulnerable situations.
- **Verifiable Trust:** Trust is not assumed; it is earned and computationally verified.
- **Prosocial Incentives:** The system's mechanics should encourage honest, prosocial, and community-building behavior.
- **Local-First Resilience:** The system must be functional in austere environments with intermittent or no connectivity.
- **Circular Economy:** Every interaction is a value-exchange, fostering a sustainable flow of resources.
- **Total User Awareness:** The user must be notified of every action related to their assets, ensuring complete transparency.
- **Neutral Infrastructure:** The system is a neutral 'highway' for value exchange and does not judge the content of transactions, only their verifiable integrity.
- **Sacrosanct Location Privacy:** A user's physical location is protected by default.
- **Programmable Agency:** Users can deploy automated agents to act on their behalf.
- **Composable Services:** Complex solutions can be dynamically assembled from basic components.
- **Harnessing Local Knowledge:** The system is designed to capture, value, and share hyperlocal data.
- **Inalienable Data Rights:** Users retain ultimate control over their data, enabling the "right to be forgotten."
