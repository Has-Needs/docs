# Advisors: A Foundation of Theory and Practice

*This document outlines the relevance of the key advisors to the Has-Needs project, whose expertise provides a powerful foundation of credibility.*

### Dr. William B. Miller, Jr. - The Architect of Living Systems

Dr. William B. Miller, Jr. is the physician and evolutionary biologist who champions the theory of **Cognition-Based Evolution (CBE)**. His work provides the deep scientific and philosophical blueprint for the Has-Needs protocol.

- **Relevance:** Dr. Miller's theory posits that complex, resilient biological systems are not designed top-down, but **emerge** from the cognitive, cooperative interactions of trillions of individual, autonomous cells. This perfectly mirrors the architecture of Has-Needs, which replaces rigid, engineered structures with a living, digital ecosystem that is intelligent and resilient by design. His work provides the first-principles scientific basis for *why* the protocol's bottom-up, decentralized structure is destined to succeed.

### Dr. Dan Diamond - The Expert in Real-World Crisis

Dr. Dan Diamond is an internationally recognized expert on disaster response and leadership in high-stress environments. He directed the medical triage unit at the New Orleans Convention Center after Hurricane Katrina and has been on the front lines of numerous global crises.

- **Relevance:** Dr. Diamond provides the "ground truth" for the project. He has been a direct, first-hand witness to the catastrophic failures of the centralized, top-down aid systems that Has-Needs is designed to replace. His work focuses on the human psychology of crisis and what enables individuals to become resilient "thrivers" rather than passive "victims." His expertise ensures the protocol is not just technically sound, but is also deeply aligned with the realities of human behavior under extreme duress.

### Synthesis

The combination of these two advisors provides a perfect pairing of deep theory and practical, on-the-ground experience. **Dr. Miller provides the "how"** (the architectural principles of resilient, living systems), while **Dr. Diamond provides the "why"** (the documented failure of current systems) and the **"who"** (the human beings the system must serve).
