# Frame 4: The Philosophical Narrative ("The Next Enlightenment")

The first Enlightenment established the rights of the individual in the face of the absolute power of the monarchy and the church. Today, we live under the rule of new absolute powers: centralized tech platforms and captured state institutions that have eroded our freedoms.

Has-Needs is a tool for a **'Second Enlightenment.'** It uses the power of modern cryptography and decentralization to safeguard the inalienable rights of the digital age: the right to own your identity, the right to control your data, and the right to exchange value freely. It is a philosophical and technical framework for securing individual liberty for the 21st century and beyond.
