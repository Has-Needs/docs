# UI/UX Vision: The Agregoire Interface

*This document outlines the core concepts for the user interface and user experience of the Has-Needs protocol, known as Agregoire.*

---

### Core Principles

- **Visual & Intuitive:** The interface prioritizes visual, direct manipulation over text-based menus and forms.
- **Language Agnostic:** The core interaction model is designed to be independent of any specific language, relying on universal symbols, colors, and actions.
- **Data as Tangible Objects:** Users interact with their data as if it were a collection of tangible, physical objects, fostering a sense of ownership and control.

### Primary Visualization: The Personal Globe

The main user interface is a **3D globe representation** of the user's personal data space. This "Personal Globe" serves as the home screen and primary navigation tool.

- **Own Has/Needs:** The user's own resources (`Has`) and requests (`Need`) are visualized as distinct points of light or energy on the globe's surface.
- **Match Candidates:** Potential matches for the user's Needs appear as orbiting satellites or points in the near-space around the globe.
- **Agreements:** Active agreements or exchanges are represented by stable, visible lines or tethers connecting the user's globe to other nodes.

### Interaction Model: Drag-and-Drop Data Icons

All interaction is based on the direct manipulation of iconic representations of data.

- **Data Icons:** Every piece of data—a skill, a need, a resource, a contact, a piece of personal information—is represented as a unique, persistent icon.
- **Direct Manipulation:** Users can literally drag and drop these icons to perform actions. For example, dragging a "Has" icon onto a "Need" icon could initiate a proposal for an exchange. Dragging a "personal data" icon into a "contract" icon could grant specific access.

### The Lingua Franca: Data as Color (RGB)

To create a truly universal, language-agnostic system, the protocol uses **RGB color values as a foundational "lingua franca"** for data.

- **Universal Translator:** Any piece of data, no matter how complex, can be hashed or mapped to a unique RGB color value or a "color chord" (a combination of colors).
- **Visual Representation:** This allows for the immediate visual representation of complex data. A user's reputation might be a color gradient. A specific skill set could be a unique color signature. This allows for at-a-glance understanding without requiring language.

### The Data Story: Monetizable Personal Narratives

This is the mechanism for creating value from personal data in a sovereign way.

- **Combining Data:** Using the drag-and-drop interface, a user can combine multiple data icons into a new, unified "package." For example, a user could combine their "Location Data for 24 Hours" icon (blue) with their "Purchasing Needs" icon (red) to create a new, temporary "Market Research" package (purple).
- **Monetization:** This new data package is itself a "Has" that can be offered in a value exchange. A company could then make an offer to purchase this specific, limited, and consensual "data story" directly from the user, who is compensated for it. This creates a user-driven market for data narratives.
